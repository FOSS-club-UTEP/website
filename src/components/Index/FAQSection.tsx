        Joining the Open Source Club is a great way to gain experience
        for your CV and develop a strong project portfolio. Working on
        open source projects or leading a group as a tech-lead positively
        distinguishes you from other job applicants. We also host
        professional development meetings, resume reviews, and
        presentations from tech employers (IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).
        <br /><br />
        The club is also a fun way to meet up and network with people
        with common interests. We frequently host social events or
        hackathons for members to participate in.
