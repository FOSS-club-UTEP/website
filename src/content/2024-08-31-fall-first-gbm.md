The UF Open Source Club (UF OSC) invites you to our first GBM of the Fall 2024 semester. Join us on __Tuesday, September 3rd, 2024, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the Computer Sciences and Engineering Building, room CSE A101__. For directions, please see the campus map [here](https://campusmap.ufl.edu/#/index/0042).

OSC is committed to fostering a community where students can collaborate on open source projects, improve their technical skills, and engage with like-minded peers. Our club offers regular coding sessions ("casual coding" meetings) where members contribute to open source development. We welcome members of all backgrounds and experience levels: our tech-leads regularly host technical workshops and are eager to assist beginner/freshmen programmers. Additionally, If you're already developing open source software, OSC is a great opportunity to pitch your project and recruit student contributors.

The first GBM will provide an overview of our current projects, discuss the project proposal process, and explain how casual coding sessions will take place. We'll also be covering the contribution process for those enrolled in **Intro to Software Engineering (CEN3031)**.

See you there!
