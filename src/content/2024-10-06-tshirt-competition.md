subtitle: Help OSC design its next official T-Shirt
---

The Open Source Club needs your help in designing its official T-Shirt for the Fall 2024 semester. We are calling for participants to submit their best T-Shirt designs by **October 15th** for a chance to have their T-Shirts printed and distributed by OSC (for free!). Everyone is encouraged to apply, irrespective of club participation/membership or UF enrollment status.

We are looking for creative designs that evoke the spirit of open source culture, embrace University of Florida and Open Source Club identity, and motivate members to participate in open source development. T-Shirt graphics must incorporate **no more than three colors** (excluding the color of the T-shirt itself) and should be submitted in one of the following formats: `AI, PSD, PNG, or PDF`. Profanity and NSFW graphics are strictly prohibited.

The winning design will be determined through voting, with more details to be announced on Discord after the submission deadline.
